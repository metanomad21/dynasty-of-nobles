# Dynasty of Nobles 🏰👑

## Background 📜

Dynasty of Nobles is a GameFi game that simulates the Chinese historical dynasties, starting from the division of the noble and warlord factions during the late Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. 🇨🇳

## Core Logic 🧠

The noble families engage in a zero-sum game under limited resources. 💎

## Main Gameplay 🎮

- Players can act as nobles or warlords, or both, by simulating the management of their own families, forming alliances with various noble families, and investing in different warlords to conquer other forces and win the game. 🏹🛡️
- The game is cyclical, with each round ending and the surviving players being able to forge special NFT items for use in the next round. 🔄🏅
- Players do not have a coordinate-based map; their birthplaces have regional characteristics. Battles are conducted using an asynchronous PVP system similar to Clash of Clans. ⚔️
    ### Victory and Defeat 🏆
    - If a noble family does not invest in a warlord and is attacked, they will be destroyed, with some resources being destroyed and some being taken by the victor. 💥
    - Defending and losing will not result in immediate death, but the defender will lose Token1, which can lead to an inability to support warlords. After multiple defenses fail, morale, soldiers, and provisions are all depleted, and if attacked without a defender, the family will be completely destroyed. 😢
    ### Platform Token 🪙
    - Players can become landowner nobles by staking the platform token (Token1). 🌐
    - Token1 can only be purchased through ICO, with a limited issuance and no current mining plan. 🚫
    - After staking, Token2 is generated daily as staking rewards. 💰
    ### NFT 🎴
    - Players can also purchase NFT blind boxes with U/Token1 to obtain military resources like generals and soldiers, becoming warlords responsible for battles. 🎁
    - After each round, surviving players can destroy Token1/Token2/Token3 to forge special NFT items for use in the next round. 🎉
    - Victorious players receive additional NFT item rewards. 🌟
    ### Noble Gameplay 🕴️
    - Nobles invest by purchasing ICO Token1, and possible returns include:
        - Token1 price increases as more players join, allowing players to withdraw staking and sell tokens to exit. 📈
        - Token1 generates Token2/Token3, which can be traded for profit. 💸
        - Tokens1 obtained from conquering other players can be sold for profit. 🏦
    - Nobles do not need to focus on the details of battles but can focus more on the input-output ratio. 🧮
    - Token2/Token3 held by nobles can be invested in warlords. Multiple nobles can form alliances and share the spoils of war. 🤝
    ### Warlord Gameplay ⚔️
    - Investment is in U/Token1, with possible returns including:
        - Initial sneak attacks on weaker nobles to obtain Token1 rewards. 🤫
        - Directly participate in attacking other players, with victories resulting in Token1 rewards. 🥇
        - Obtain or synthesize rare general NFTs, which can be sold for profit. 🌟
    - Warlords require Token2/Token3 for internal and external affairs and military consumption. 🛡️
    - Battles can result in the drop of special general fragments and materials for upgrading generals. ⚔️
